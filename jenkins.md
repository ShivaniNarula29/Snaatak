### How Jenkins Work?
Jenkins can run on various operating systems as a server. It requires Java 8 or above to be installed successfully. After installation, it runs as a Java servlet.The whole working of Jenkins depends on the pipeline we create. A Pipeline is a set of steps that Jenkins uses to perform actions on the latest commit. Due to these tests, we get to know the applicationâ€™s stability, and the developer can know if his/her changes are not breaking the build. This set of steps can also be written in JenkinsFile.

#### Explanation
| Stage     | Description                                                             | Example                                                                 |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Commit    | Developers commit code to a version control system.                     | A developer pushes code to GitHub `main` branch.                        |
| Build     | Jenkins pulls the latest code and compiles it.                          | Jenkins compiles a Java project using Maven (`mvn clean install`).     |
| Test      | Automated tests are executed to ensure code correctness.                | Jenkins runs JUnit tests or `pytest` for a Python app.                 |
| Stage     | Code is deployed to a staging/test environment.                         | Jenkins deploys to a QA EC2 instance or Kubernetes test namespace.     |
| Deploy    | Code is deployed to production if all prior steps pass successfully.    | Jenkins pushes Docker images to production and updates the live site.  |

| Notifications         | Configure alerts for build failures/successes                                 |
| Resource Management   | Clean up old builds/artifacts and manage concurrent builds                    |
| Audit Logging         | Enable logging/audit trails for compliance and traceability                   |
| Documentation         | Maintain documentation for job structure, credentials, and pipeline logic     |

### Conclusion

Jenkins remains a cornerstone of CI/CD orchestration in DevOps workflows. Its flexibility, extensibility, and community support make it ideal for automating builds, tests, and deployments across diverse environments. While alternatives exist, Jenkins excels in large-scale, complex automation setups when configured and managed properly.
