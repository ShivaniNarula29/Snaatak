## Purpose

This document outlines the value of tracking SonarQube metrics. It highlights their role, pros and cons, and optimal usage practices. SonarQube is an open-source platform frequently used to maintain and improve code quality through continuous inspection. Monitoring its metrics ensures the codebase remains robust, clean, and in line with development standards.

## Why Monitor SonarQube Metrics?

- Ensure high availability for developers and pipelines  
- Detect and resolve performance bottlenecks early  
- Maintain code quality and security feedback loops  
- Monitor trends in technical debt and vulnerabilities  
- Proactively alert on threshold violations (e.g., slow response time, heap memory overuse)

### Step-by-Step Workflow Overview

This flow describes how SonarQube metrics are collected, analyzed, and monitored for quality thresholds.

#### 1. Code Commit
Developer pushes code to a VCS (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

#### 2. CI/CD Triggers SonarQube Analysis
CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) triggers SonarQube analysis.

#### 3. SonarQube Server Processes Code
Scans for:
- Bugs
- Vulnerabilities
- Code Smells
- Test Coverage
- Duplications
- Complexity

#### 4. Metrics Generated and Stored
SonarQube generates metrics and stores them in its database.

#### 5. Monitoring Tools Fetch Metrics
Monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) fetch metrics to track trends.

#### 6. Thresholds Breached? (Decision Point)
System checks predefined thresholds like:
- Bugs > 0
- Coverage < 80%
- Duplications > 5%

**➤ If Thresholds Are Breached**  
Action:  
- Send alerts via email, Slack, etc.

**➤ If Thresholds Are Not Breached**  
Action:  
- Metrics logged for dashboard visualization; no alert sent.
