## ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

| Pros                                                        | Cons                                                        |

| Flexible access control and merge policies                  | Self-hosting requires infrastructure and licensing overhead |
| REST APIs and DevOps insights                               | Smaller open-source community                              |

## Conclusion

Bitbucket is a powerful, secure, and flexible tool for managing code repositories, especially suited for teams already using Jira and other Atlassian products. Its built-in CI/CD, security features, and integration capabilities make it a good fit for enterprise environments. However, for community/open-source focused teams, GitHub might offer better exposure and community collaboration.
