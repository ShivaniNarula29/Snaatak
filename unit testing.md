## Introduction
This document explains the basics of Python unit testing, covering key concepts, popular tools, best practices, and recommendations. It aims to help developers write effective tests to improve code quality and reliability.

---

## What?
Unit testing refers to the process of writing and running small tests that check the correctness of individual parts (units) of a program, usually at the function level.

---

## Why?
- Ensures individual code blocks work as intended.
- Makes future code changes safer and more reliable..
- Helps find bugs early in development.
- Promotes modular, maintainable code.

### Explanation
| **Step**         | **Description**                                                  | **Example**                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write Test Cases | Write code to test individual units or functions.                | Write a test for a function that adds two numbers: `assert add(2,3) == 5`     |
| Run Test Suite   | Execute all test cases to check if the code behaves as expected. | Run `pytest` or `python -m unittest` to run all tests.                        |
| Pass or Fail?    | Check if tests passed or failed.                                 | If the addition test passes, move forward; if it fails, proceed to debugging. |
| Continue         | If tests pass, continue development or deployment.               | Merge code to main branch or deploy to production.                            |
| Debug Code       | Investigate and fix the code causing test failures.              | Find out why `add(2,3)` returned `4` instead of `5`.                          |
| Rewrite Test     | Modify or add new tests if needed after fixing the code.         | Adjust the test if the function signature changed or add edge cases.          |

## **Different Tools for Unit Testing in Python**

| **Tool**  |  **Description**                                                  | **Why It's Used**                                                                      |  **Advantages**                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unittest`   | Built-in module inspired by Java’s JUnit.                           | Used when you want a standard, built-in solution for writing and running tests.          | No external installation needed; integrates well with Python’s standard library. |
| `pytest`     | Powerful, easy-to-use framework with a rich plugin ecosystem.       | Used for writing concise tests with advanced features like fixtures and parametrization. | Cleaner syntax, better output, supports plugins and complex test scenarios.      |
| `nose2`      | Successor of `nose`, extends `unittest` functionality.              | Used when migrating from `nose` or extending `unittest`-based test suites.               | Auto test discovery, compatible with `unittest`.                                 |
| `doctest`    | Allows writing tests inside docstrings that validate documentation. | Used when you want to ensure your code examples in docs actually work.                   | Great for documentation testing, minimal setup.                                  |
| `hypothesis` | Property-based testing tool that generates test cases dynamically.  | Used to find edge cases by automatically creating a wide range of inputs.                | Detects unexpected bugs, supports generative testing.                            |

## Disadvantages of Unit Testing
| **Disadvantage**                       | **Description**                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time-Consuming                         | Writing comprehensive tests requires significant time and planning |
| False Sense of Security                | Tests may pass even if logic is flawed (if test cases are weak)    |
| Maintenance Overhead                   | Updating tests when logic changes can be cumbersome                |
| Not a Substitute for Integration Tests | Unit tests alone can’t catch all system-level issues               |

## Best Practices

| Best Practice                        | Explanation                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keep Tests Independent               | Each test should run in isolation                                           |
| Use Meaningful Names                 | Test method names should reflect their purpose                              |
| Focus on One Scenario per Test       | One test should validate one behavior only                                  |
| Automate Test Execution              | Integrate tests with CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions                  |
| Use Mocks and Fixtures Wisely        | Avoid external dependencies during testing                                  |
| Aim for High Coverage, but Smartly   | Coverage is useful, but focus on quality of tests over quantity             |

## Recommendation
We recommend using **pytest** as the primary tool for Python unit testing because it is modern, simple to use, and integrates well with CI/CD workflows.

|  **Reason**                   |  **pytest Advantage**                                       |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Easy to Use**                | Simple syntax and minimal boilerplate                          |
| **Readable Output**            | Clear test failure messages and tracebacks                     |
| **Powerful Plugin System**     | Extendable via a rich ecosystem of plugins                     |
| **CI/CD Friendly**             | Seamless integration with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.        |
| **Supports Fixtures and Parametrize** | Advanced features for efficient and reusable test cases      |
